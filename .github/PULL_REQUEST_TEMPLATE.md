## Problem and result

Describe the concrete trigger and the resulting behavior. Add `Refs #N` or
`Closes #N` for an existing repository issue. Assign an owner and a change-type
label. Match the issue milestone when present; release PRs require a milestone.

## Verification

State the exact checks run and their results. Distinguish local protocol tests
from live native-agent sessions. Include measured evidence for performance claims.

## Compatibility and risks

Describe state/schema changes, migration or rollback needs, and remaining limits.
