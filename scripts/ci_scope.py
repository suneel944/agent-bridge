"""Decides which legs of the Check workflow a pull request needs.

Every change runs the full test suite on one Ubuntu leg. The remaining Python
versions and macOS run only when a change touches what can behave differently
across platforms or interpreters, and the WSL leg only when package, launch or
process code changes. A path this module does not recognise, a push to
``main``, a manual run and any failure to read the diff all select every leg,
so uncertainty never skips a check.

One exception narrows the WSL leg: a file whose only edits are version lines,
as in the release automation's version bump commit, counts as tooling rather
than package code. The commit before the bump already ran the WSL leg on the
same code, and the WSL leg is the slowest one, so a bump pushed straight after
a crossing merge would otherwise hold ``main`` for another full suite. Every
Ubuntu and macOS leg still runs for it.

The ruleset on ``main`` requires the macOS and WSL check names, so the
workflow skips those jobs with a job-level condition rather than a trigger
filter: a skipped job still reports its check, while a workflow that never
starts leaves the check pending.
