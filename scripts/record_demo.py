"""Records the coordination demo and renders it as an animated SVG.

The recording is produced by running Agent Parley, never by writing terminal
text. Every frame holds one real command line and the bytes that command
wrote to a pseudo-terminal of fixed size, so the wrapping, the table widths
and the refusal text are the ones an operator sees.

The run is told in nine chapters, each opened by a title card: parallel
lanes on two providers, a work order every lane reads, claims and advisory
reservations with the collision a second lane meets, guardrails in the native
hooks, a handoff offer and its acceptance, a plan revision, a run budget,
unattended integration, and the operator dashboard. A closing card names the
install command.

The story and the stub-lane harness live in the package, in
`agent_parley.demo_scenario` and `agent_parley.demo`, so ``agent-parley
demo`` runs a short cut of the same chapters and cannot drift from this
recording. The native CLIs are stubs. The harness writes ``claude`` and
``codex`` executables that run ``exec sleep 900`` onto the front of
``PATH``, so the lane processes are real, the coordination path is real, and
only the model session is a stand-in. Lanes are launched one at a time
because two simultaneous launches race for the same server lock.

Reservations have no command-line verb; they are MCP tools. Those steps call
the same tool dispatch the served transport calls, through
``agent_parley.store.call`` with the lane's own registration credential, and
the frame shows the tool name, its arguments and its real result.

Rendering needs no recorder binary. ``vhs``, ``asciinema`` and ``agg`` are
not used and are not required: this module writes the SVG itself from the
captured frames, giving each frame one ``animate`` element so exactly one is
visible at a time. A renderer that ignores animation shows the first frame.

Nothing from the recording machine survives into the asset. The temporary
state directory, the demo repository and the operator's home are rewritten
to a ``/home/dev`` shape before a frame is drawn.

Regenerate with ``make demo-stub``, or::

    uv run --locked python scripts/record_demo.py

The result is written to ``docs/assets/demo.svg`` and is the published
asset. ``scripts/record_live.py`` (``make demo``) records real clients
instead and needs model quota. The asset is
referenced from ``README.md`` through a pinned jsdelivr URL, because the
README is also the PyPI long description and relative image paths do not
resolve there.
