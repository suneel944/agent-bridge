"""Durable records of the situations that wait on an operator's answer.

A decision is one question an absent operator must answer before a lane can
move on: a handoff to accept, a permission prompt, a dirty worktree, an
integration to verify. Each one is recorded under the project's private state
directory with a stable identifier, the options that answer it with one marked
recommended, and whether acting on it can be undone. Observing the same
situation again refreshes its record rather than opening another, so every
situation holds exactly one open decision however many processes see it.

Delivery is durable. A decision is queued when it opens and is marked sent
only after every transport accepted it; a refused or abandoned send is retried
with a growing backoff on the next supervision poll, so a short-lived hook
that records a decision and exits at once still reaches the operator. A
sender leases the decisions it is about to send, so two processes flushing at
once do not both send them. The decisions one flush finds due go out
together, as one digest message carrying one inline keyboard row per
decision on Telegram and the text reply each takes on every other transport.

Decisions are recorded only while notifications are configured, so a hook in
an unconfigured estate pays nothing for them. The record holds no credential:
its text is composed from coordination fields, and the transport settings
stay in `notify`.
