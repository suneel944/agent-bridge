"""Withdrawal of one lane from a project at that lane's own request.

A lane that has finished, or that a peer has asked to stand down, used to have
nowhere to go: going idle reads as a stall and is woken again, and the only
retirement was an operator command. Retirement is therefore a transition the
lane itself can make, and it is ordered so that nothing it held is stranded if
a later step fails.

Work leaves first. Every issue the lane still owns is released back to the
pool, and every handoff offered to it is declined so the peer that offered it
owns it again rather than waiting on a lane that is gone. Work is released
rather than offered back to its sender, because an offer leaves ownership on
the offering lane until the recipient answers, and a retired lane can answer
nothing; the sender is told by mail instead, and the issue is immediately
claimable by any lane. Ready work is the exception: it must stay claimed until
verified integration completes, so a lane holding any is refused before a
single issue is released, rather than left half retired.

The worktree leaves next, and only when Git reports it clean. A lane with
uncommitted changes keeps its worktree and reports the paths, because
retirement never discards work. A checkout Git cannot inspect is treated the
same way: no opinion is not a clean reading.

The manifest mark is last, and it is what makes the retirement durable. The
participant stays in the roster carrying the time it retired, so status can
report it and the supervisor can skip it, and the operator re-admits it with
the same `participant add` command that created it.
