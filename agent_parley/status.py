        Args:
            directory: Private state directory for the common repository.
            data: Project manifest holding this participant.
            agent: Participant that owns the lane.
            edited: Reserved paths an operator changed in the base checkout,
                read once per project by the caller.
            advanced: Paths this lane holds that the base branch changed
                since the lane forked, read once per project by the caller.
            context: Project-wide readings the caller already took for this
                frame, holding the issue ledger, the supervision
                configuration, project usage, pending scheduled items and the
                open read transaction they were answered from. Absent, this
                lane takes each reading for itself.

        Returns:
            The lane's session, availability, branch, reported outcome and
            mailbox counts, together with any native dialog the lane records as
            holding its client. An unreadable mailbox is reported as an error
            beside the rest of the lane rather than failing the whole report.
            A lane with a state record has its session and availability read
            from that record alone, through `supervision.recorded_presence`,
            so the activity file cannot report a condition the record does
            not hold; only a lane with no record yet is read from the file.
            `current_task` is the lane's own last report or registered task,
            never the operator's last prompt, and each claim carries its
            recorded title, whether it ended on the forge, the seconds since
            it last progressed and its cached pull request.
