"""Delivers coordination to a lane whose CLI raises no delivery hook.

A native lifecycle hook is how a lane usually receives mail, handoff notices,
operator edits and reservation state: the hook answers a turn boundary with
bounded context. An adapter whose CLI cannot raise those events would
otherwise run a whole session with nothing delivered, and that gap belongs to
any CLI without hooks rather than to one vendor.

This path is launcher-owned. It runs beside one native session, reads the
same mailbox the served checkpoint reads, publishes what waits into a
lane-private file the coordination prompt tells that lane to read each turn,
and falls back to a terminal notice when that file cannot be written. Each
delivery is recorded in the participant event log the served path records
into, so a polled lane reports delivered context like any other.

Delivery is not enforcement. Nothing here decides a tool call, and an adapter
missing a required guard is still refused at launch.

    while any message it carried is unread, and leaves once the lane calls
