"""Applies the recommended default to a reversible decision left unanswered.

Hands-free work stalls whenever the operator is away: a question nobody
answers holds its lane indefinitely, even when the choice is reversible and
has an obvious answer. `KINDS` is the one table of decision kinds. Each kind
declares whether it is ``reversible`` or ``irreversible``, the option the
service recommends, and the command that undoes that option.

A reversible kind waits `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for an answer. When it expires
unanswered, `settle` returns the recommended option as ``applied by
timeout`` with the evidence it used, `record` appends that to the lane's
report log and `announce` sends one line naming what was done and the
command that undoes it. A reversible kind whose evidence is already
conclusive, such as an issue closed by a merged pull request from the
current claim generation, is settled without asking at all and recorded as
``applied on evidence``.

Each supervision poll runs `sweep` over the project's open decision records.
`EVENTS` names the table kind each recorded notification kind settles as; a
record whose kind it does not name is left open. A settled record is answered
with its own recommended option by `ANSWERED_BY` and handed to its lane the
way any other answer is.

An irreversible kind never times out: a merge to the default branch, a
release or tag, discarding uncommitted work, deleting a branch and every
native permission prompt always wait for an answer. A kind this table does
not know is treated as irreversible, so a misspelled or newer kind fails
closed.

A project can record, with `agent-parley timeout set`, that a kind is
always asked or that its timeout is longer than the default. The policy is
kept in the private manifest under ``timeouts``. It can only make a kind
more cautious: a timeout shorter than the default is refused, and no policy
gives an irreversible kind a timeout.
