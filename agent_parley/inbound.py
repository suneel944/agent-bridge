"""Status queries and decision answers an operator sends over the Telegram bot.

The reader is the one path that carries anything back from a chat. It
carries two things. The `status` verb, with the filters the command line
already accepts, replies with that reading; the filters are declared once by
the command line and reused here, so the two readings cannot drift apart. An
answer to a decision `decisions` recorded, given by tapping one of the
decision's buttons, by `decide ID OPTION [NOTE]`, or by replying to a
one-decision message with the option and a note, is recorded on the decision
and handed to the waiting lane as supervisor mail, which wakes it. An
irreversible option takes a second, confirming tap. Nothing here claims,
hands off, answers a native permission prompt, or types into a session, and
a note reaches a lane only quoted beside the answer.

Admission is two independent checks for text. The update must come from the
configured chat, and its first word must be the passcode read at service
start from the environment or the settings `notify setup` stored. Only a
salted digest of that passcode is held, it is compared in constant time, and
a message that fails either check is dropped in silence rather than answered
with a hint. Five failures inside ten minutes lock the path for an hour and
send one outbound notification saying so; the counter and the lock live only
in memory and are forgotten with the process. A button tap carries no
passcode: it is admitted only from the configured chat and only for an open
decision this state root issued.

Updates arrive by long polling the Bot API from this process, so no port is
opened, no webhook is registered, and nothing is exposed on the network.
