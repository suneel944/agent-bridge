"""Throwaway sandbox that runs the coordination story with stub lanes.

``agent-parley demo`` shows lanes claiming, colliding, being refused, handing
off and appearing in ``top`` without a native CLI, a model, an account or a
network. It builds everything under one new temporary directory: a Git
repository, a private state home, a coordination service on a free loopback
port and stub ``claude`` and ``codex`` executables that run
``exec sleep 900``. The lane processes, the service, the MCP tool dispatch
and the native hook are all real; only the model session is a stand-in. The
user's state home, repositories and any running service are never read or
written, because every child runs with ``AGENT_PARLEY_HOME`` and
``AGENT_PARLEY_PORT`` pinned to the sandbox and with no inherited lane
credential.

The same harness, `Recorder`, drives ``scripts/record_demo.py``
(``make demo-stub``), which renders the full story from
`agent_parley.demo_scenario` as the published recording.

Every child is started in a session of its own, so a Ctrl-C at the terminal
reaches only the demo and never interrupts a command half way through. The
demo then waits for the command in flight, stops the service and the lanes,
removes the sandbox and, where ``/proc`` is available, ends any process still
working inside it. Cleanup runs with interrupts ignored, on success, on
``q``, on Ctrl-C and on an exception alike.

The sandbox is created under ``/tmp`` when that directory exists, because the
per-user temporary directory on macOS is long enough to push a lane's control
socket past the Unix socket path limit.
