"""The coordination story the demo tells, one function per chapter.

Two callers drive these chapters through the same stub-lane harness in
`agent_parley.demo`: the ``agent-parley demo`` command runs the short cut
`tour`, and ``scripts/record_demo.py`` (``make demo-stub``) runs the full
nine-chapter `record` and renders it as the published recording. Because both
read the steps and captions from here, the command and the recording cannot
drift apart.

Every step runs a real ``agent-parley`` command, a real MCP tool dispatch or
the real native hook; only the model session is a stand-in.
