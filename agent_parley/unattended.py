"""Unattended integration authorized by an explicit project policy.

`participant merge` is an operator command. A project can also record, in its
private manifest, a standing authorization to integrate the ready work of a
bounded list of issues into one named target branch without an operator at
the keyboard. The authorization is `integration.unattended`: the ``target``
branch the base checkout must have checked out and the ``issues`` whose ready
work it covers. It is absent unless the operator writes it with
`agent-parley unattended set`, which refuses to run from an assigned worktree,
and no served coordination tool reads or writes it, so a lane cannot grant
itself the authority or widen it.

Authority never relaxes the terms of a merge. Every eligible lane is merged by
the same `_integrate_lane` step `participant merge` uses, under the project
merge lock and the lane's session lock, with the configured verification gate,
any required operator approval and the source-commit binding all applied.
What the policy adds is a stricter precondition: the claimed issue is listed,
the claim generation is current, the work is reported ready at a commit the
lane still sits on, the base checkout is on the target branch, every
dependency is verified complete, a verification command is configured, and no
peer's advisory reservation covers a path the work changed.

Every attempt leaves a durable decision record in the lane's report log with
bounded evidence: the claim generation, the source commit, the target branch
and commit, the verification command and the outcome. A refusal names the
condition that failed and what to do about it. Each attempt evaluates those
inputs afresh, so a changed commit, a moved base or a new claim generation is
judged on its own and never inherits an earlier decision. A replay after a
recorded integration merges and completes nothing.

A merge or gate failure goes through the merge step's durable recovery record,
which holds every other lane and moves the claim to repair; `failed` then
records the unattended decision beside it. Unattended integration never
repairs: while the base carries an unverified integration, every attempt is
refused and repair stays with the lane owner or the operator. Integration
dispatch from the supervision service is deliberately not wired here.
