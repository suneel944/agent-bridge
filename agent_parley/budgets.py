"""Derives lane consumption against advisory budgets and enforced run limits.

A budget is a line an operator draws, not a gate the runtime enforces. The
readings it is compared with already exist: the tokens a lane's own native
client recorded, the coordination calls the store served for it, and the
hours its session process has been alive. No vendor is asked and no price is
applied, so a token budget is a count and never spend. Crossing a limit marks
the lane, prints the figures and sends the lane one notice; nothing is
stopped, revoked or refused, and what to do about it stays the operator's
decision.

A run budget is the one opt-in exception. An operator who records one makes
the same three readings, summed over every lane of the project, a gate on
what the service starts: wakes, work dispatch, capacity retries and
launches. The sum lives in a durable ledger that keeps the highest reading
of each source, a transcript or a session, so a restart, a replaced lane or
a retried session never resets it. Every transcript a lane's client kept is
read from a durable byte offset, so records that ended between polls or
were written while the service was down still count, while history from
before the run budget was recorded does not. A resumed session whose new
transcript replays earlier messages is counted again. Counting is still an
observation, not a meter: tokens appended to a transcript deleted before
the next poll and Codex rollouts outside the most recent ones ``records``
considers are not seen, so the run can exhaust late by that much. Reaching a
limit records one exhaustion that only an operator's resume clears; running
sessions are asked to checkpoint and stop at their next hook event, and
nothing is killed, discarded or approved on a lane's behalf.
