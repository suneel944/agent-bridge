"""Derives every condition an operator should act on from one status reading.

The view reads. It reuses the status reading, the supervision thresholds and
the store classification; it records nothing, wakes nobody and moves no
ownership. Each row names one lane and one cause, how many items share that
cause, how long the oldest of them has held, and either a command the
operator can paste or the actor already handling it, so an operator returning
to twenty lanes reads what needs them now instead of comparing timestamps
across `status`, `top`, `issue list` and `doctor`.

A remedy is derived from the lane's recorded state, never from the condition
alone. A lane whose own client holds an unanswered prompt, whose session
process is gone, or whose calls are paused cannot read mail, so it is never
offered `say`. A lane the coordination service is still waking carries what
that loop has already attempted rather than a command that would duplicate
it, and an active lane is never told to complete or stop a session it is
working in. A worktree holding uncommitted work names the worktree and the
files it holds, because retiring the lane would drop its claims to clean one
directory.

        operator. A prompt or dialog is reported only while the session
        process that showed it may be alive; once that process is gone no
        terminal shows the prompt, and the lane carries only the stopped
        remedy. A row about the lane's state says when the dialog watcher
        or the liveness sample inferred that state and names the hook the
        lane's client lacks, because no hook confirmed it. A quiet lane
        that refused a peer a key it still holds is reported with the lanes
        it refused and how long it has been quiet, because the refused lane
        saw the refusal and nobody else did. Once the release deadline the
        service gave that lane passes, the row belongs to the operator as a
        decision. A
        second client sending hooks under the lane's identity is named with
        its process while it lasts, because its events are ignored. A quiet
        lane is inactive only while it owes work, meaning a claim it has not
        delivered, or while something recorded keeps it from its next turn.
        A lane that delivered everything it holds is at rest, and waking it
        spends a turn on nothing. Uncommitted work is reported only once
        the session process is gone, because a running session owns its
        worktree and a quiet reading does not make its edits abandoned. A
