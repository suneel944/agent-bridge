"""Reads usage and capacity from session records native CLIs already write.

A native client keeps its own session transcript under its config home. That
transcript reports the tokens the client itself counted for the session. Agent
Parley reads those files and never asks a vendor: no network request, no API
key, and no accounting of its own. The number is therefore what one client
reported about one session. It is not billed spend, it is not a price, and two
vendors count differently enough that their numbers do not compare.

Every reading is best effort. Absent, unreadable, malformed or unexpectedly
shaped records report nothing rather than raising, because an operator view
must not fail on a client's private file format.

    """Folds only the records appended since the previous reading.

    A live session appends to its record continuously, so re-reading the whole
    file on every refresh would make the view pay for the session's history
    again each second. The reading remembers the byte offset it stopped at and
    resumes there, consuming at most ``MAX_READ`` bytes and stopping on the
    last complete line, so a partly written record is never parsed. A record
    that grew by more than the budget catches up over later refreshes. A
    replaced or truncated file starts a new reading.

    A line longer than ``MAX_READ`` holds no newline in a full chunk, so the
    offset moves past that whole chunk rather than stalling on it forever.
    The next reading then starts inside the oversized line; its remaining
    fragment is not a JSON object and is skipped like any unparsable line,
    and folding resumes from the following newline.

    Every adapter folds only records carrying a usage object, whose key ends
    in ``USAGE_MARK``, so a line without those bytes is skipped unparsed.
    Most transcript lines are prompts and tool output with no usage at all.

    Args:
        path: Session record file.
        fold: Adapter-specific accumulator for one parsed record.
        reading: Previous reading for this lane, or an empty mapping.

    Returns:
        The updated reading.
